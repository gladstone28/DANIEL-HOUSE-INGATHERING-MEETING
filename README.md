#### Agenda Items

**1. Pledges:**
The Budget for Ingathering collection was approved at Congregational Members meeting for the amount of J$2 million, which would be J$500,000.00 per House.
Because of the inability to have a Fund raising event this year the Planning Committee volunteered to assist the Houses to 
increase their Ingathering funds collection through fund raising events with the objective that each house could raise their target by another J$250,000.00 each.

The meeting was informed that a inter-house Fundraising competition had been launched and announced at the previous Service by Sister Paula (last Sunday) by way of an Ingathering Thermometer Chart
which would be displayed at the Notice Board and updated on a Monthly basis.
