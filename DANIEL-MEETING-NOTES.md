#### Agenda Items

**1. Pledges:**
The Budget for Ingathering was approved at Congregational Members meeting for J$2 million, which would be J$500,000.00 per House.
Because of the inability to have a Fund raising event this year the Planning Committee volunteered to assist the Houses to 
increase their Ingathering funds through fund raising events so that each house could raise another J$250,000.00 each.

**2. Fund Raising Competition:**
The meeting was informed that a inter-house Fundraising competition had been started and announced in service by Sister Paula last Sunday by way of an Ingathering Thermometer Chart

**3. Web App:** 
A web Application was programmed to be used for timely update of the status of the Ingathering Competition. A link to the information would be provided for members to click to see the
status of the Houses Ingathering Collection on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis. Members can also use it to send comments to House leaders. Comments can be to raise their pledges as wee
as to encourage and congratulate Houses.
